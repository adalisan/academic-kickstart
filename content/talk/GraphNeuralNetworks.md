abstract = "Graph Neural Networks have been recently popular in adapting deep learning methodology and models to graph based data, in order to learn from the relationships between examples with a feature representation and/or from the graph topology in graph data. I review some of the principles of this field along with example applications. In addition, I present an overview of  my related work."
